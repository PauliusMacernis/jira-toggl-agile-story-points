# Intro  
We use Toggl for a real-time time tracking and Jira for issues/tasks management.  
Now it's the time to adopt Agile, or at least the one very good part of it - the story points.  
"When this task will be done?" - don't ask a human this question anymore, this is the piece of code that is about to answer your question better than a human.  

# Agile story points
It all begins when the whole team meets together and plays Planning poker on each of issues in Jira.   
What is the outcome of Planing poker? The main one in this case is the scope of the issue written in the square brackets in front of the issue name in Jira. Couple of examples:  
 * "[0.5] Quite easily resolvable issue, up to half of an hour is needed and it's done, no worries, all looks clear."  
 * "[1] May take 1-2 hours of intensive non-interruptible work until it is done, most of the issue is pretty clear."
 * "[2] May take 2-4 hours of intensive non-interruptible work until it is done, some unknown pieces exists but it is easily solvable."
 * "[3] May take 3-6 hours of intensive non-interruptible work until it is done, most likely will exceed a full working day or even two-three under regular working conditions. The issue involves some unknown pieces but the unknown seems to be under control."
 * "[5] Quite huge issue, will definitely go for more than 1 day and we should split it before continuing. This task may also contain too much of unknown." 

# Jira
Giving story point values in Jira is the most important part here.

#Toggl
When you enter your time in Toggl time tracker, you have to enter the issue identifier key. It looks something like this in Jira "AP-108" and use it in front of every time entry in Toggl. For example, use this time entry title in Toggl time tracking to refer to Jira issue: "AP-108 Optionally may place some short info on the task too".

#Google
Some tables are pre-made so you can copy-paste them into Google sheets (or other system) and enrich the data tables given with some visual diagrams, etc.
